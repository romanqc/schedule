I want to refrenece readings like 'Two-Eyed Seeing and other lessons learned within a co-learning journey of bringing together indigenous and mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing' and in an anthropological sense, maybe talk about how I as a researcher am displaced from Warren County, but I as per Dr. Kassam's methodology, this is accounted for, and the ways we go about doing research in locations that are not necissarliy tied to us, suggest an approach of extensive and intensive research. This is something that I can continuously bring up as I continue to meet with professor Jordan and Sully."
